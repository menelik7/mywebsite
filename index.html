					<p id="story">I am originally from Ethiopia and have been living in the U.S. for half my life.  I currently work as a Project Engineer at BenchMark Management LLC, mainly managing vertical construction projects.  My job is challenging and requires a good deal of time management.  I enjoy what I do, but it does not provide opportunities to be genuinely creative.</p>

					<p>I have been fascinated with software development dating back to the first time I was introduced to the Commodore 64.  The owner's manual included pre-written programs.  One rendered miniature hot-air ballons flying across the screen in random directions; and the other, was a segment of a musical keyboard.  The rush I felt when the codes worked was indescribable.  The fantasy of getting there is even more addictive.  I have finally surrendered to my passion.</p>

The user simply enters the phone number he/she wishes to lookup, and voila!  Information specific to the user is dynamically displayed, as well as the option to lock-in on the associated address with the help of Google Maps API.  The reverse phone is made possible by Whitepages API.
